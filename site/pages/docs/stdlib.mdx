## package blockchain

Structures of a [CKB Cell](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/tech-explanation/cell).

Since everything is a collection of bytes, these structures just a wrapper of byte slice.

### [Script](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/tech-explanation/script)

```
Script: {
  code_hash: HexString
  args: HexString
  hash_type: Uint8, there are 4 allowed values: {0: "data", 1: "type", 2: "data1", 3: "data2"}
}
```
